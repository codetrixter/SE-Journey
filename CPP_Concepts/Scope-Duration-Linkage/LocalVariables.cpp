/**
 * *SCOPE:
 * - Scope (of an identifier) referes to the availablity of that identifier during the course of the program execution.
 * - If the identifer can be accessed, then it is (in scope), else (out of scope).
 * 
 * *Duration:
 * - This refers to the rules that govern when and how a variable is created(instantiated) or when it is destroyed.
 * - usually it referes to the varibales lifetime.
 * 
 * *LINKAGE:
 * - An identifierâ€™s linkage determines whether a declaration of that same identifier in a different scope refers to the 
 * same object (or function).
 * 
 * !importanat points to rem.:
 * - Local vairable have block scope.
 * - All varibale names within a scope must be unique.
 * - Local variables have automatic storage duration.
 * - Local variabels have no linkage.
 * 
 * *NOTE: Local variables must be defined in the most limited scope.
